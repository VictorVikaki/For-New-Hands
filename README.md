**About the Projects**

This repository showcases simple but practical Python projects to help new hands get comfortable with the language and GUI development using tkinter. The projects include essential concepts such as event handling, widgets, and user interaction in Python.


**Project List**

Here are the projects in this repository:

1. Bill Management System (First Commit): A basic application for managing bills and expenses using a tkinter interface.
2. Progress Bar (Second Commit): A tkinter-based project demonstrating how to create and manage progress bars.
3. Progress Bar (Third Commit): Another example of a tkinter progress bar implementation, showcasing different features or improvements.


**Technologies Used**

Python 3.x

tkinter: Used in all projects for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).


**Installation**

Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/For-New-Hands.git

Navigate to the project folder:
        
         cd For-New-Hands

Set up a virtual environment:
        
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:
        
  For tkinter, it comes pre-installed with Python, but make sure you have it available:
        
        python -m tkinter


**Usage**

Each project can be run independently. Navigate to the relevant project directory and run the script to launch the tkinter GUI.

For example,

            python PROGRESSBAR 2.py #to run the third commit
